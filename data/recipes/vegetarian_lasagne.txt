Ingredients:

* 1 pound lasagna noodles
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
* 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
* 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to the package directions. Drain the noodles and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
4. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
5. In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a layer of sauce. Top with a layer of noodles, then a layer of ricotta cheese, spinach, red bell pepper, and basil. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of sauce. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top.
6. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
7. Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving.
