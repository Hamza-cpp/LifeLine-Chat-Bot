Ingredients:

* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine
* 1/4 cup chicken broth
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

Instructions:

1. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the chicken strips in the flour mixture.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken strips and cook until browned on all sides.
3. Add the Marsala wine and chicken broth to the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
4. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and asparagus. Cook until the asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes more.
5. Serve immediately.
